# Big number process
Created by Vu Dinh Anh on October 8th 2019
## Purpose:
I have coded some Java classes for people who want to process gigantic numbers without losing data.
## How to use:
Open file "DriveCode.java" where I have written all examples and instructions.
There are suffixes but only upto Novendecillion. If your number is larger than Novendecillion, it will use SNF (Suffix Not Found).
## BigNum class methods:
- public void setNumber(ArrayList<String> number)
- public ArrayList<String> getNumber()
- public void setNumtxt(String numtxt)
- public void displayNumber()
- public void displayNumberExtra()
## BigOper class methods:
- public ArrayList<String> addition(ArrayList<String> num1, ArrayList<String> num2)
- public ArrayList<String> subtraction(ArrayList<String> num1, ArrayList<String> num2)
- public ArrayList<String> multiplication(ArrayList<String> num1, ArrayList<String> num2)
- public ArrayList<String> division(ArrayList<String> num1, ArrayList<String> num2)
  - public ArrayList<String> returnR()
## Note:
There are methods to check which one is bigger and they are equal or not.
